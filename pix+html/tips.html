	    Default file paths in Feffit minor mode
	  </span>
	</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	<P>
	  One of the really tedious things about using <span
	  class=ease>EASE</span> is setting paths for the <span
	  class=program>FEFF</span>, data, and output files every time
	  a new <span class=file>`feffit.inp'</span> file is created.
	  When I start a new bit of EXAFS analysis, I usually create a
	  new directory to hold my work, then create subdirectories
	  called <span class=file>`feff/'</span>, <span
	  class=file>`data/'</span>, and <span
	  class=file>`fits/'</span>.  This imposes some level of order
	  on the files involved in data analysis and I am usually very
	  consistent about choosing those directory names.  Here is a
	  snippet of elisp code that you can put in your <span
	  class=file>`~/.ease'</span> file that will set the data
	  paths to those default values for a new file, but will not
	  change them for an old file: <pre>
	      (add-hook 'Feffit-mode-hook
                 '(lambda ()
	            (if input-feff-path ()
                       (setq input-feff-path "feff/"))
	            (if input-data-path ()
	               (setq input-data-path "data/"))
	            (if input-out-path ()
	               (setq input-out-path  "fits/")) ))
	  </pre>

	</P>
	<P>
	  Since this is a mode-hook, it will be evaluated when the
	  feffit input file is first visited.  The <span class=fixed>if</span>
	  functions check to see if the values of the data paths were
	  set from the auto-configuration line.  If they were, nothing
	  happens.  If not, they are set to my user-chosen defaults.
	  Note that <span class=fixed>(add-hook...)</span> is used rather than
	  <span class=fixed>(setq...)</span>.  You should always set hooks in
	  emacs using <span class=fixed>(add-hook...)</span> to avoid accidentally
	  overwriting any functions already in the hook.

	    What to do if you are annoyed by the autotomatically

	  </span>
	</a>
      </dt>
      <DD>
	<P>
	  Two possibly annoying features of <span
	  class=ease>EASE</span> are the Local Variables list that
	  gets written to the end of every file and the fact that you
	  have to answer a question about what kind of file you are
	  editing when you start a new input file.  That <span
	  class=ease>EASE</span> writes the Local Variables list can
	  be quite convenient for the user, but it is wrting something
	  to the file that the user might not have chosen to write.
	  The question is simply annoying if you just want to make a
	  quick change and hurry along.
	</P>
	<P>
	  There are several variables that you can set in your <span
	  class=file>`.ease'</span> file that might be helpful if
	  either of these features irks you.  Each of these is a logical
	  flag, thus should be set to <span class=fixed>t</span> or
	  <span class=fixed>nil</span>.
	</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <P>
	      <span class=fixed>ease-always-start-generic-flag</span>:<br> When
	      non-nil this tells EASE to always start editing a file in
	      generic minor mode whenever it cannot otherwise determine
	      the file type.  Generic minor mode lacks most of the
	      functionality of EASE, but it load slightly quicker than
	      the other minor modes and it avoids the question about the
	      file type.  You can always select
	      <span class=fixed>Switch Programs</span> from the
	      <span class=fixed>Input:Miscellaneous</span> menu
	      (<span class=fixed>C-c C-b s</span>) to set the file type
	      interactively.
	    </P>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <P>
	      <span class=fixed>ease-hide-autoconfig-flag</span>:<br>
	      When non-nil this tells EASE to narrow to the region
	      between the beginning of the file and the beginning of
	      the Local Variables list.  This has the effect of hiding
	      the Local Variables list from sight.  It is still used
	      by EASE, but it is out of sight.
	    </P>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <P>
	      <span class=fixed>input-prohibit-autoconfig-flag</span>:<br>
	      When non-nil this tells EASE to never write the Local
	      Variable list.  Using this in conjunction with <span
	      class=fixed>ease-always-start-generic-flag</span> is
	      sensible.
	    </P>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <P>
	      <span class=fixed>input-time-stamp-flag</span>:<br> When
	      non-nil this tells EASE to never write a time stamp to
	      the input file.
	    </P>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    <P>
	      <span class=fixed>ease-mouse-overlays-default-flag</span>:<br>
	      When nil (note that this behaves opposite to all the
	      others in this section) this tells EASE to not set the
	      mouse-faces.  Thus, when nil the color over a filename
	      will not flash when the mouse moves near it.  This
	      doesn't have to do with the Local Variables list, but if
	      someone dislikes the list then he probably doesn't like
	      the mouse-faces either.
	    </P>
	  </LI>
	</UL>
	<P>
	  Here is some code for your <span class=file>`.ease'</span>
	  file implementing everything in this section.  Note that
	  what I have listed here is the opposite to the default
	  behavior.

	  <PRE>
	    (setq ease-always-start-generic-flag   t
	          ease-hide-autoconfig-flag        t
	          ease-prohibit-autoconfig-flag    t
	          ease-time-stamp-flag             t
	          ease-mouse-overlays-default-flag nil)
	  </PRE>
	</P>
      </DD><P>

      <dt>
	<a name="after-run-hook">
	  <span class=header>
	    Using "input-after-run-hook"
	  </span>
	</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	<P>
	  <span class=ease>EASE</span> has a facility for performing
	  user-specified chores when it is done running a program.
	  The following code is an example of this.  This example will
	  cause <span class=ease>EASE</span> to display the result of
	  a fit from <span class=program>FEFFIT</span> in R space
	  immediately after completing the fit.
	  <pre>
	    (add-hook 'input-after-run-hook
	        '(lambda ()
	           (if (string= input-program-name "feffit")
		       (Feffit-plot-r))))
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  Note that this will attempt to plot the fit regardless of
	  whether <span class=program>FEFFIT</span> ran correctly.
	  Thus, this might be something that you put into your <span
	  class=file>`.ease'</span> file, but comment out until you have
	  an input file that know is free of mistakes.
	</p>
	<P>
	  This example is for having EASE open the <span
	  class=file>`feff.inp'</span> generated by an <span
	  class=program>ATOMS</span>
	  run immediately upon finishing the <span
	  class=program>ATOMS</span> run.  <pre>
             (add-hook 'input-after-run-hook
                 '(lambda ()
                    (if (string= input-program-name "atoms")
                        (input-jump-to-log-file))))
	  </pre>
	</p>
	<P>
	  To use both of these, you can either put both expressions in
	  your <span class=file>`.ease'</span> file or do something like
	  the following <pre>
             (add-hook 'input-after-run-hook
	         '(lambda ()
	            (cond ((string= input-program-name "atoms")
                           (input-jump-to-log-file))
	                  ((string= input-program-name "feffit")
		           (Feffit-plot-r)))))
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  You can then string together special after-run instructions
	  for each of the different programs.
	</p>
      </DD>

      <dt>
	<a name="calc">
	  <span class=header>
	    Automatically expanding evaluation lines in atoms.inp
	  </span>
	</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	<P>
	  Just as there is a hook that is run after program execution
	  finishes, there is one that run before program execution
	  starts.  I find it convenient to have <span class=ease>
	  EASE</span> make sure that evaluation lines in an <span
	  class=file>`atoms.inp'</span> file are expanded before
	  running <span class=program>ATOMS</span>.  Putting this in
	  the <span
	  class=file>`.ease'</span> file accomplishes that:

	  <pre>
               (add-hook 'input-before-run-hook
	          '(lambda () (and (string= "atoms" input-program-name)
		      	           (Atoms-evaluate-buffer)
			           (save-buffer))))
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  Evaluation line expansion is a nifty feature of <span
	  class=ease>EASE</span>.  You can define atoms coodinates
	  using a line like this:

	  <pre>
	      &#033;+ Mn     0.0     3/4     1/8    mn1
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  and it will be expanded to this
	  <pre>
	      &#033;+ Mn     0.0     3/4     1/8    mn1
              Mn     0.0000  0.7500  0.1250 mn1
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  Similarly you can define an atom coordinate using variables and
	  math expressions.  This
	  <pre>
	      &#033;+ Ti      0.5     0.5     (0.5 + q*ti)
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  expands to this
	  <pre>
	      &#033;+ Ti      0.5     0.5     (0.5 + q*ti)
              Ti      0.5000  0.5000  0.5377
	  </pre>
	</P>
	<P>
	  assuming that the following definition line is found somewhere
	  in the input file:
	  <pre>
	      &#033;- ti = 0.0377	q = 1
	  </pre>

	</P>
	<P>
	  Note that the evaluation and definition lines are comments
	  and will be ignored by <span class=program>ATOMS</span>.
	  The evaluation functions require
	  <a href="http://www.synaptics.com/people/daveg/">
	    the calc package</a>.
	</p>

      </DD>
      <dt><a name="speedbar"><span class=header>Using Imenu and
			       speedbar</span></a></dt>
      <dd>
	<P>
	  You can use imenu rules in <span
	  class=program>FEFFIT</span>, <span
	  class=program>AUTOBK</span>, and phit minor modes.  <span
	  class=fixed>M-x imenu</span> and <span
	  class=fixed>M-x imenu-add-to-menubar</span> now do
	  interesting things in input mode.  This is particularly
	  handy for use with <a
	  href="ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub/zappo/public_html/speedbar.shtml">
	    speedbar</a>.  Put the following in your
	  <span class=file>`~/.ease'</span> file to enable
	  input file support in speedbar.

	  <pre>
		(if (featurep 'speedbar)
          	    (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".inp"))
	  </pre>
	</p>
      </DD>

      <!--   <dt><a name="extend"><span class=header>Extending EASE to
	   cover new programs,
	   e.g. diffkk</span></a></dt>
	   <dd>EASE is easily extended to cover programs not in the core
	   distribution.  If you have an emacs lisp file with code defining
	   a minor mode for a new program, put that file in the emacs load
	   path and put lines like these in your <code>.ease</code> file:
	   <pre>
             (setq input-programs-alist
            (append input-programs-alist '(("diffkk" . Diffkk-mode)) ))
	   </pre>
	   Substitute "diffkk" with the name of your program. <p>

	   Diffkk is a real program.  You can obtain it <a
	   href="http://cars1.uchicago.edu:80/~newville/dafs/diffkk/">here</a>
	   and you can obtain EASE support for it <a
	   href="ease-diffkk.tar.gz">here.</a> To use the EASE support
	   for diffkk, unpack the tarball in the directory containing the
	   EASE distribution.  Don't forget to byte-compile the
	   <code>ease-diffkk.el</code> file.  <p> -->
