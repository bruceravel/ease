    <H1>Using EASE with Windows</H1>
    <P>
      This page offers some hints for using <span
      class=ease>EASE</span> with Windows 95, 98, or NT.
      Before starting, I really need to make a disclaimer.  I have
      used Emacs under Windows 9x/NT, but only in passing.  In fact,
      the last time I regularly used Windows of any sort, the latest
      and greatest was 3.11.  That was many moons ago.  <span
      class=ease>EASE</span> was developed on a Linux computer.  I
      have used it on other Unixes.  Anything that is useful on these
      pages is entirely due to the effort of Jingfeng Yan
      &lt;yanjfbj@publica.bj.cninfo.net&gt.  He and I exchanged many
      emails over the course of several days to come up with the
      information contained on this page.
    </P>
